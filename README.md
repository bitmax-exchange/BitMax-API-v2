BitMax Pro API is the latest release of APIs allowing our users to access the exchange programmatically. It is a major revision of the older releases. The BitMax team re-implemented the entire backend system in support for the BitMax Pro API. It is designed to be fast, flexible, stable, and comprehensive.
