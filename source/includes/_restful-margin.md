# RESTful APIs - Margin Trading

A margin account allows you to increase your purchasing power beyond the account total balance by borrowing assets. Compare to cash trading, 
margin trading has more complicated trading rules and may carry much greater risks. Please refer to 
[BitMax.io Margin Trading Rules](https://bitmaxhelp.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360016415774-BitMax-io-Margin-Trading-Rules) for more details.
