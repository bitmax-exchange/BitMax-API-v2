# BitMax API Documentation V2

This document contains new `v2` APIs with improved features. At the moment, only limited functionality is supported. However, we plan
to increase coverage extensively. 

Meanwhile, please refer to [BitMax | API Document](https://github.com/bitmax-exchange/api-doc) for a more complete set of APIs. 

<aside class="warning">Please note that this document contains beta APIs subject to further changes.</aside>
